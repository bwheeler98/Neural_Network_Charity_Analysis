# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## optimizing
1) changed replace application and replaced class cutoff numbers and increased nodes by 10 --> increase number to 800 and 1500 from 500 & 1250
2) change number of epochs --> decreased epochs from 100 to 50
3) changed replace application and replaced class cutoff numbers and epoch number--> decrease number to 400 and 1000 and epochs now 75

- dropped afflication column for all of these optimizing attempts
